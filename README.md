# Music Player

Hey! This is my **first music player project** and it’s super fun 😎.  
I made it using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and I even added a song **made by Suno AI** and written by **ChatGPT**.  
Integrating AI in your learning is so cool and fun! 🎵

## Features

- Play / Pause the music  
- Skip forward / backward buttons (just UI for now)  
- Progress bar to see the song’s current time  
- Cool circular buttons with hover effects  
- Song image with a nice border and shadow  
- Interactive and smooth design  

## How I Built It

I wanted something **simple but stylish**, so I used:  

- **HTML** for structure  
- **CSS** for styling, hover effects, shadows, and circular buttons  
- **JavaScript** for play/pause functionality and progress bar  
- **Remix Icons** for the buttons  

I also added a **custom slider** and **dynamic play/pause icon change** to make it feel like a real music player.

## Notes

- Currently, skip forward/backward buttons don’t actually change the song (just UI)  
- Works best on desktop; mobile needs a bit more tweaking  
- You can replace the song and image with your own

## Inspiration

Got the idea from a **YouTube channel** and wanted to try making my own interactive music player.


## Fun Fact

The song here is **made by Suno AI**, and the lyrics are **written by ChatGPT**.  
It’s really fun to **mix AI with learning and creativity**! 🚀
